To understand the motivation for the double node graph, consider the railway junction in the figure below. Dgraph 1 On the railway network, paths p-q-r and p-q-u exist, in both directions. However, in a conventional undirected graph representation, there would also be a path r-q-u. Dgraph 2 When we extend the graph concept to include two sides of each node, there is no longer a path r-q-u. Dgraph 3 So, the double node graph is similar to a graph, with the difference that each node has two sides. A train entering a node from an edge connected to one side of the node can only exit the node through edges on the opposide side of the node. This model allows a sense of local directedness without deciding on a global direction concept such as up/down or outgoing/incoming often used in railway engineering. A global directionality requires considering special cases to handle railway networks where a train's up/down direction may change without the train reversing its direction, such as the balloon loop example .

Syntax: signal <name> Example: signal sig1 Enter section ⬇ : a train whose front passes the current node will enter a detection section. Note that a train detector (e.g. axle counter) or a track circuit border will typically need to be translated into four enter / exit statements, an enter for the section on each side of the detector, and an exit for each section on the opposite sides. The rationale for this representation is that it is a low-level instruction that the train can simply read and execute, and that is allows for more exotic train detection setups, such as overlapping sections.

The exit is an identifier for a signal which is not directly used for simulation, but which is need for planning for knowing which routes can extend this route. The entry section is an identifier for a detection section. When this detection section becomes occupied, the route is considered to be in use, and the signal stops signalling movement authority to avoid other trains from using the same route before it has been activated again. The length is a number indicating the driving length of the route path. This length is used by the planner, and also by the simulator in the communication of movement authority from the control system to the train, in case of a signalling system which transfers movement authority lengths (either on-line, through train protection systems or radio communication, or off-line, by having the train driver familiarize with lengths though a railway line's handbook). This length is not adjusted for stopping margins. The section list is a comma-separated list of section which must be exclusively allocated before the route can be activated. Sections should be listed in the order of occupancy by a train running the route path. The switch list is a comma-separated list of switches and corresponding positions (e.g. sw1 left ). The contains list is a comma-separated list of node which the route contains. It is used for planning, to fulfil requirements of visiting specific nodes by activating routes. Finally, a list of release conditions determine how the resources required by the route are de-allocated. The syntax is as follows release { length <number> trigger <section-name> resources [<resource-name>, ...]\n} The lines in the above release statement contain the following: The length is a number indicating the length of the partial route path. The trigger is an identifier for a detection section. After this trigger has turned occupied and then subsequently vacant again, the resources are released. The release list is a comma-separated list of resources, i.e. sections and switches, which cease to be allocated after the trigger event has occurred. Note that if no releases are specified, a default release condition is added which frees the whole length and all resources, using the last section in the path as the trigger.","title":"Interlocking 🔒"},"examples/case_arna_byhand.html#case-a":{"id":"examples/case_arna_byhand.html#case-a","title":"Case A","body":"Station from Norwegian engineering project, preliminary design. vehicle passengertrain length 150.0 accel 1.0 brake 0.9 maxspeed 20.0 movement passengertrain { visit [b1] visit [b2iii]\n}","breadcrumbs":"Case studies » Case A"},"examples/crossing.html#crossing":{"id":"examples/crossing.html#crossing","breadcrumbs":"Verification mode » Verification examples » Crossing","body":"Two-track station with two-way traffic.

The specification may include requirements on the infrastructure such as running time, train frequency, parking, crossing, overtaking, and simultaneous combinations of these. Specifications work by listing locations that a train needs to visit, and optionally setting the maximum time between pairs of such visits. The dispatch plan is produced by a planning procedure using automated reasoning techniques, which efficiently finds a sequence of route activations which takes the trains where they need to go, and can show a complete list of alternative route sequences for achieving the goal. The railperfcheck program does the work of the dispatcher on a railway station or a remote control facility. When not only location visit contraints, but also timing constraints are specified, suggested plans are automatically sent to the rolling dispatch simulator, and the timing of location visits are measured. If one plan fails, railperfcheck will find more plans until one or more of them satify all requirements. Automated planning The verification mode allows fully automated verification of performance properties, using minimal input documentation. This allows construction projects to bring in performance verification into frequently changing early-stage design projects, avoiding the costly and time-consuming backtracking required when later-stage analysis reveals unacceptable performance. Specification format -- specify performance properties in a high-level format, avoiding unneccesary details such as specific tracks, signals, and routes. This saves effort and is especially useful when these details are unknown or subject to change, as is the case in construction projects. Smart planning -- solve complicated maneuvering puzzles automatically. Smart planning Full automation -- meaning that as your track and component layout changes during the project, performance specifications can be verified again with no extra effort.

The wait statement may be given without a time parameter. This will cause the simulation to wait until all route activations are finished (including route activations which are part of a train's activation process). This may be used to ensure that one set of route allocations happen before another.

Discrete event simulation is an event-based simulation approach where a set of processes are able to wait for events from each other, or wait for time to pass. When a process waits for time to pass, it is inserted into a priority queue, and the simulation clock is advanced up to the next pending process' activation time. The main processes types in the rolling simulation are trains and routes. Routes are further divided into an activation process, movable element processes (switching), a release trigger process, and a signal trigger process. The route processes model the workings of the dispatch and interlocking systems, while the train process models the workings of the train, the driver, onboard protection systems and communcations. Dispatch mode A dispatch plan (1) is executed by sending commands to the interlocking controller (2), which communicates movement authority to the trains (3). Rolling calculates train trajectories with a given dispatch plan using an infrastructure and interlocking controller model with the following features: Topology and lengths -- trains travel on a model of the railway network with given distances, guided by switches and other movable track elements. Infrastructure model Laws of motion -- trains move within the limits of given maximum acceleration and braking power. A train driver model is used to plan ahead for braking so that the train respects its given movement authority. Velocity profile Allocation of resources -- a resource-based model of the interlocking ensures that conflicting routes are not communicated to the trains. Requested movement may be queued so that the dispatch happens as soon as resources are available. Allocation of resources Communication -- traditional optical signalling and automatic train protection systems impose a communication constraint which may be the cause of lower performance. Rolling's communication model is suitable for optical signalling, point-based and linear traditional train protection systems, and radio-based communications such as ETCS.
