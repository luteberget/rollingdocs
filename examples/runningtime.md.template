# Running time verification

Using the two track bidirectional station from previous examples, we now turn
to verifying the running time for a single train across the station.

The properties to be verified are summarized in the `usage` file:

```haskell
$RAILWAYUSAGE
```

Running the `railperfcheck` program on this usage gives success, and outputs
the following dispatch plan:

```haskell
$RAILWAYDISPATCH

```

### Witness

The plan represents a witness for the satisfaction of the properties given in the `usage` file, and the results can be inspected as usual.

$RAILWAYVIEW
