# Simplest examples
# Single

This is the simplest example of a working train station in `rolling`.

The infrastructure is a single signal with detection sections in the front and back.

```haskell
$RAILWAYINFRASTRUCTURE
```

There is one entry and one exit train route.

```haskell
$RAILWAYROUTES
```

We dispatch a short train.

```haskell
$RAILWAYDISPATCH
```

And the results from `rolling` are:

$RAILWAYVIEW
