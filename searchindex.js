in the node statement. The possible object types are: Signal 🚦 : a signal with the given name is located at the current node. Note that this has no actual impact on trains, as only the sight statements can add the signal to the train's communication list. This statement is used for visualization purposes. Syntax: signal <name> Example: signal sig1 Enter section ⬇ : a train whose front passes the current node will enter a detection section. Note that a train detector (e.g. axle counter) or a track circuit border will typically need to be translated into four enter / exit statements, an enter for the section on each side of the detector, and an exit for each section on the opposite sides. The rationale for this representation is that it is a low-level instruction that the train can simply read and execute, and that is allows for more exotic train detection setups, such as overlapping sections. Syntax: enter <section-name> Example: enter section1 Exit section ⬆ : a train whose back passes the current node will exit a detection section. Syntax: exit <section-name> Example: exit section1 Sight 👁 : after visiting the current node, trains can see a given signal for a given travel distance. Typically, this node will appear at a given distance before a signal, and the given distance will be the travel distance from the sight object's node to the signal. Syntax: sight <signal-name> <distance> Example: signal sig1 400.0 Switches may also be considered to be objects, but appear in their own statements since they also relate nodes (see the switches section ).

Routes are the atomic unit of allocation from the dispatcher's point of view. Note that the atomic unit of de-allocation is typically smaller than the route, a feature of interlockings which is called partial release . The routes file contains set of whitespace-separated route statements , each declared by the following syntax: route <name> { entry <signal-name> exit <signal-name> entrysection <section-name> length <number> sections [<section-name>, ...] switches [<switch-name> <switch-position>, ...] contains [<node-name>, ...] <release>*\n} The lines in the above route statement contain the following: A route has a name , which is the identifier used from the dispatch plan to request this route for activation. The entry is an identifier for a signal which is used to signal the movement authority given by this route when it is activated. The exit is an identifier for a signal which is not directly used for simulation, but which is need for planning for knowing which routes can extend this route. The entry section is an identifier for a detection section. When this detection section becomes occupied, the route is considered to be in use, and the signal stops signalling movement authority to avoid other trains from using the same route before it has been activated again. The length is a number indicating the driving length of the route path. This length is used by the planner, and also by the simulator in the communication of movement authority from the control system to the train, in case of a signalling system which transfers movement authority lengths (either on-line, through train protection systems or radio communication, or off-line, by having the train driver familiarize with lengths though a railway line's handbook). This length is not adjusted for stopping margins. The section list is a comma-separated list of section which must be exclusively allocated before the route can be activated. Sections should be listed in the order of occupancy by a train running the route path. The switch list is a comma-separated list of switches and corresponding positions (e.g. sw1 left ). The contains list is a comma-separated list of node which the route contains. It is used for planning, to fulfil requirements of visiting specific nodes by activating routes. Finally, a list of release conditions determine how the resources required by the route are de-allocated. The syntax is as follows release { length <number> trigger <section-name> resources [<resource-name>, ...]\n} The lines in the above release statement contain the following: The length is a number indicating the length of the partial route path. The trigger is an identifier for a detection section. After this trigger has turned occupied and then subsequently vacant again, the resources are released. The release list is a comma-separated list of resources, i.e. sections and switches, which cease to be allocated after the trigger event has occurred. Note that if no releases are specified, a default release condition is added which frees the whole length and all resources after the last","title":"Interlocking 🔒"},"dispatch.html#dispatch-":{"id":"dispatch.html#dispatch-","breadcrumbs":"Simulation model » Dispatch 👋","title":"Dispatch 👋","body":"The dispatch plan file represents a timeline of the following types of events: Trains entering the infrastructure from a given entry route.

To understand the motivation for the double node graph, consider the railway junction in the figure below. Dgraph 1 On the railway network, paths p-q-r and p-q-u exist, in both directions. However, in a conventional undirected graph representation, there would also be a path r-q-u. Dgraph 2 When we extend the graph concept to include two sides of each node, there is no longer a path r-q-u. Dgraph 3 So, the double node graph is similar to a graph, with the difference that each node has two sides. A train entering a node from an edge connected to one side of the node can only exit the node through edges on the opposide side of the node. This model allows a sense of local directedness without deciding on a global direction concept such as up/down or outgoing/incoming often used in railway engineering. A global directionality requires considering special cases to handle railway networks where a train's up/down direction may change without the train reversing its direction, such as the balloon loop example .
