NOR's model of the Norweigan national rail network. This example demonstrates conversion from railML on a simple two track station. Tracks, switches, signals and detectors are imported from railML, while routes are derived from signal and detector placement. This may or may not be equal to the actual routes in use on the station, but suffices for our demonstrations.
